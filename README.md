# AnycubicDelta_on_SKRProV11
- Marlin 2.x configuration file for Anycubic delta linear plus on SKR pro v1.1 board

I own an Anycubic 3D printer kossel delta linear plus, which I bouht Mar 2019.
It runs on Trigorilla board(Atmega 2560) with A4988 drivers and makes a lot of noise.

I decided to upgrade the control board to BIGTREETECH's SKR pro V1.1 with TMC2208,
and got success with no big difficulties.

I hope these files to give a litte bit of help to some people under similar situation. Good luck.
